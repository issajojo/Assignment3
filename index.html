                Hi, my name is Jarrod Franchi, my student number is s3900062
                and my student email is s3900062@rmit.student.edu.au, I am from Italian and Mauritian backgrounds.
                I am tri-lingual, my first language is French, then learned English as well as learning Italian for all my primary and secondary schooling.
                I completed year 12 In the year 2020. An interesting fact about myself was that throughout the duration of my secondary schooling 
                I ran a small business for building and selling custom-built Gaming Computers for people who were inexperienced in building them,
                also teaching them how to build them if they wanted. I find building computers a very enjoyable and relaxing pastime.
                Apart from being a tech nerd, I enjoy playing football, soccer, table tennis, and swims either on the beach or in pools.
                I enjoy thrills and going on long bike rides and doing dangerous stunts like jumping off ramps and man-made mountains with my bikes,
                my mates and I often go on large mountain biking trips, when we are not, we go for drives in the mountains.
                Whilst being a large tech nerd, I am a big motorhead! I love anything that has a motor, also my favorite car brand would be Holden or Holden Special Vehicles.
                My interest in IT has been with hardware and software, for hardware I enjoy, as mentioned before, building computers.
                I am fascinated with how components work in unison (or sometimes against each other).
                I also find the progress of computers and how they have evolved. Whilst the physical hardware of computers is fascinating, 
                the software that runs on them is quite interesting too.
                I am blown away by how the software that has been developed can help people and that helps people in their everyday life.
                My interest in IT started a while ago, maybe in 2010. We had an old Compaq Desktop, and I started to tinker around with various operating systems like Windows Vista, Windows 7 and learning about how components work and what their purposes are.
                I also dabbled with Virtual machines and their limitations. This sparked an interest in computers and from then on, I found myself picking up old computers and fixing them, taking them apart, and learning about how all the hardware works.
                Another large influence was my father since he worked largely to do with circuits and electrical items such as fans and lights,
                I was already more guided to the hardware side of IT.
                Since I feel knowledgeable to do with the physical side of computers, I wanted to learn about the software side.
                I have also worked for a company called GS1 (year 10 work placement) which taught me network topology as well as the management of various user’s accounts stored on a centralized server. The group I am a part of is In Memory of John.

                John Duong, [student number] - S3896165, [student email] - s3896165@student.rmit.edu.au
                My name is John Duong (My online tag is issa jojo but my internet friends mainly call me by jojo).
                I am Vietnamese and speak it at home with some english mixed in sometimes, mainly to my siblings that I live with.
                I just completed highschool last year and I am currently a first year studying Bachelor’s of Information Technology.
                An interesting fact about me is I have a scar on my forehead which had occurred when playing tag in the house, 
                and running into a door with a nail sticking out of it.
                I enjoy playing games with the homies although I think I've sunk a lot of hours into mobas, specifically League of Legends and Dota2 (mainly League)
                but I am still trash at these games for the amount of time I’ve put into them (:D).
                I also like reading manga as well as manhwa, listening to music, and watching anime.
                A passion of mine is to try and make my friends happy when they are down or even just to make them laugh when they are not;
                I also am passionate about supporting and bringing people’s well beings up. The group I am apart of is In Memory of John.

                My Name is Dane Steven Trotman Scerri my student number is S3897381 I am 18 years old and was born on 31/05/2002. 
                I live in the quiet town of Sunbury with my family of 5 which consists of my mother, my brother, and my twin sisters. 
                I am the oldest of four children and my mother is a single parent. because of these circumstances, there is added responsibility and constant challenges. 
                These challenges have enabled me to develop leadership skills, problem-solving, and the ability to work under stress. something interesting 
                about me would be that I was born 31 weeks premature. weighing 1290gs my hands were webbed and my body was transparent. 
                I spent 2 months of my life in a special care unit in the sunshine hospital. I am currently enrolled into a course of 
                information technology at RMIT university. Since my enrollment I have become more independent and interested in developing my academic potential. 
                When I was in high school, I found that I struggled with social interaction with my cohort. however, studying a course with people of similar interests 
                has enabled me to see a more social side of my personality which was not prevalent in my earlier years.

                My name is Michael Ly (pronounced as Lee), my student number is s3899226 and my school email is s3899226@student.rmit.edu.au, 
                I am a first-year student at RMIT, so there is a lot of things that are new to me. I want to learn everything there is to learn about IT 
                because technology has been growing drastically over the past few years. I was born in Vietnam and moved to Australia in 2012, legally. 
                My main language that I speak is English, but I can also speak Vietnamese fluently. I like to make music but recently I got interested in 
                investing in cryptocurrency, but I also try to explore new things. I never thought that I would go to university and study IT, back in year 11
                and start of year 12, I was dead set on becoming a music producer and would study music, but here I am. My favourite animal is dogs, 
                but my dad will not let me have my pet, I believe if I had a dog, I would be 10 times happier than how I am right now. My ultimate goal
                in life is to get rich, move out of my parents’ house and get a dog. My favourite thing to watch is anime, it is an easy way to forget 
                about reality for a while… I know it sounds sad. I also like working out and try my best to be consistent.

                    Overview
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The proposed project is an interactive fiction game more widely known as a ”text adven-ture” game, these are computer games where users typically interact with the in-game environment via prompts and text commands, text adventures were some of the earli-est video games and have undoubtedly become a staple in the video game industry and among programmers due their ease of development and genre agnostic design.The project will be programmed in Visual Basic .NET (VB.NET) a UI focused program-ming language that properly enforces safe programming and is part of Microsoft .NETframework;players  will  be  capable  of  adequately  exploring  a  branching  narrative  with multiple choices that impact story events and possible outcomes, overall interacting with the game beyond just selecting narrative branches despite being a text adventure game,the game will be primarily designed around a graphical user interface(GUI) but will also support Command-Line Interface (CLI) game play with reduced functionality as a result of VB.NET primarily being a GUI focused programming language.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Motivation
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The reasons behind why we chose to create a text-based game for our group project arebecause. Our entire group has all got an interest in the gaming industry; this interest doesn't just involve the games on the market.  It also includes new and upcoming games that showcase an ever-changing world where a person can take the persona of a character and do things that would be impossible in the real world.  Additionally, the advancement and implementation of technology have caused gamers to experience an increasingly realistic experience where the line between real life and the world of gaming continues to become increasingly transparent.  Games have the power to influence a person’s view of the world around them this enables the user to form relationships with other players from across the world.  The gaming industry is becoming ever more exciting and interesting and we agreed as a team that we would like to have a taste of what this industry has to offer by creating our own game.
                    Another reason behind why We intend to create a text-based game is because the ap-plication we agreed on using to create the game is visual studios which is an integrated development environment.  that has the ability to aid us by pointing out mistakes we've made along the way while developing the game’s interface and the code behind the scenes.Additionally, the majority of our group has had some experience with the visual studio as it was required to be used in our high school software development classes.  because of this familiarity with the application, it will enable us to streamline the development of the game as we do not need to become acquainted with visual studios beforehand.  This Enables us to have an increase in efficiency while in the creation stage of our text-based game.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our group project idea is to create a text-based adventure game called the mystery of the wasteland ruins.  the game will only be able to be played on pc.  because our group felt making it was compatible with mobile.  would hinder the quality of the game as we would have to adjust the images and text to fit on a small screen this would make the mobile version look far too cluttered and would negatively affect the user experience with the game.  We decided to market this game to people who like to engage in non-fiction.  This specific audience of gamers likes to use their imagination to create the environment that the game prompts who find satisfaction with deciding the game’s direction.  The target audience would need to be able to have a basic understanding of computers additionally they will require the ability to read and comprehend information in order to play the game. Since the game is text-based with a simple interface that contains an image with the text describing what is happening in the story.  the user will be able to continue the story by pressing buttons on the screen via the mouse left-click this furthers the story and will lead to different outcomes based upon the user’s choice.  by using a combination of images and text on buttons.  the user will be able to automatically understand the function of certain controls an example of this in practice is the image of a red x associating with exiting the game.  The benefit of this simple design is that it will enable the user to recognize how to play the game without needing to recall the controls. Being text orientated graphics are non-existent it will be a pop-up image depending on the user’s choices accompanied by some text giving an explanation to the goings-on with the story. For the game to function correctly it will require the play button when clicked with the left mouse button to start the story so the user can begin playing the game, the quit but-ton when clicked will need to end the game and return to the home screen this ensures the user has a way out of the game if they are finished playing.  The choice buttons when chosen via left mouse click will require the game to change the background and the text that is present to the text and image that is connected to the user’s choice additionally.

                    <p>
                        Since the project group consists of six members, the project will require members split up and complete different objectives,  thus whilst this section discusses what tools and technology will be used, group members will only need to possess some but not all of the tools mentioned;to facilitate collaborative and remote development a shared repository and version con-trol system will be required, both to ensure a clear audit trail of which group members competed which task, but to also keep track of issues with the program and progress to-wards meeting our objectives, the tool used to compete the above is GITHUB, a popularand fully featured version control system/ project management website,  GITHUB was chosen mostly because of its ease of use being a cross-platform website/system that uses Git and the fact that all members of the group are well antiquated with the website aspart of Introduction to Information Technology COSC1078 at RMIT University.All developers will require a working computer(including peripherals) whether laptop orPC(personal computer) to program the application as well as test and play it, since the completed project will be a PC program, the computer used must be possessing a modern version of windows, with the latest .NET framework installed on the device(This often automatically installed on windows 10.).To program the application, we will use Visual Basic .NET in the Visual Basic IntegratedDevelopment Environment(VB IDE) , the IDE extends the functionality of visual basic and allows for the rapid deployment of user interface(UI) elements this is because devel-opers can create elements via drag and drop and other visual techniques, however beyond empowering rapid development,  the key reason for using VB IDE and the visual basic programming language is that most members of the group have experience programming and working with the language/tool set, and the project application is not so specialised  to invariably require a specific programming language.lastly to write the story we need a word processor that can keep track of changes and allows for multiple users to work in the same file, whilst many applications have these functionalities Google Docs ease of access being accessible on web browsers, computers and  mobile  devices,  made  it  a  strong  competitor,  like  Github  Google  Docs  empower group members to create and edit documents online and collaborate with group mem-bers in real-time, all changes are tracked via revision history and all users work is clearly distinguished, Google Docs is also integrated into the project members RMIT student accounts.

                        <p>
                            The development of the text adventure game will require intermediate Visual Basic skills,enough to create a program that uses input, analyses input and provides players with a response most members of the group have these skills.Github skills  to  update  programs,  fork  programs,  download  programs,  record  progress and report an issue; all members should have these skills.Text  adventure  games  are  also  known  as  interactive  fiction  because  at  their  core  they require strong writing skills to create a compelling narrative that is strengthened by the interactive nature of the medium and not good in spite of it.Coordination and communication skills, as with all projects, members of the group will require  enough  communication  skills  as  to  compartmentalise  and  delegate  tasks,  raise discussions, issues and ideas about the direction of the project and actively participate in the competition of the project, without these skills the project cannot be completed to a high standard.

    <h1>In Memory of Dane, Formerly John</h1>
	<h2>Preamble</h2>
	<p>The name we've chosen for our group is "In Memory of John" and was joking-ly coined following John Duong's absence from class, since then the name has stuck, and John hasn't been absent.</P>
	<p>
A group consists of various individuals working in tandem, and "In Memory of John" is no different, below is an introduction paragraph for each of the five members of the group; since the previous assignment this section has only had minor changes in response to feedback provided with the notable difference being the loss of group member and friend Dane Trotman Scerri, whom has since left the group irrespective of his departure his contributions to the group have been immense and portions of his work can be found in this report.

	<h1>Team Profile</h1>
   
  <h2>Travis Lim</h2>
  	<p>Hello, my name is Travis Lim, an Australian born overseas and raised in an Indonesian household. I speak English and have completed primary and secondary education at Good News Lutheran College. Additionally, I graduated from secondary education last year in 2020 and have received an ATAR. My main hobby is gaming on my laptop with my high school friends. I am interested in the field of cyber security because during my later school years I was influenced by my computer teacher into considering the impacts of my actions online and the personal information that I leave behind for corporations to store. I completed all units of VCE software development. I am part of In Memory of John.
</p>
	<h2>Jarrod Franchi</h2>
		<p>Hi, my name is Jarrod Franchi, my student number is s3900062 and my student email is s3900062@rmit.student.edu.au, I am from Italian and Mauritian backgrounds. I am trilingual, my first language is French, then learnt English as well as learnt Italian for all my primary and secondary schooling. During 2018 - 2020 I ran a small business for building and selling custom built Gaming Computers for people who were inexperienced in building them. I enjoy playing football, soccer, table tennis and swimming either on the beach or in pools. I enjoy thrills and going on long bike rides and doing dangerous stunts like jumping off ramps and man-made mountains with my bikes. I love anything that has a motor, also my favourite car brand would be Holden or Holden Special Vehicles. I am fascinated with how components work in unison (or sometimes against each other). I also find the progress of computers and how they have evolved. My interest in IT started a while ago, maybe in 2010. We had an old Compaq Desktop, and I started to tinker around with various operating systems like Windows Vista, Windows 7 and learning about how components work and what their purposes are. I also dabbled with Virtual machines and their limitations. This sparked an interest in computers and from then on, I found myself picking up old computers and fixing them, taking them apart and learning about how all the hardware works. Another large influence was my father, since he worked largely with circuits and electrical items such as fans and lights, I was already more guided to the hardware side of IT. Since I feel knowledgeable about the physical side of computers, I wanted to learn about the software side. The group I am a part of is In Memory of Dane, formerly known as In Memory of John.</p>
	<h2>John Doung</h2>           
		<p>John Duong, [student number] - S3896165, [student email] - s3896165@student.rmit.edu.au My name is John Duong (My online tag is issa jojo but my internet friends mainly call me by jojo). I was born here in Australia in the town of Sunshine. I am Vietnamese and speak it at home with some English mixed in sometimes, mainly to my siblings that I live with. I just completed high school last year and I am currently a first year studying a Bachelor’s of Information Technology. An interesting fact about me is I have a scar on my forehead which had occurred when playing tag in the house, and running into a door with a nail sticking out of it. I enjoy playing games with the homies although I think I've sunk a lot of hours into mobas, specifically League of Legends and Dota 2 (mainly League) but I am still trash at these games for the amount of time I’ve put into them (:D). I also like reading manga as well as manhwa, listening to music, and watching anime. A passion of mine is to try and make my friends happy when they are down or even just to make them laugh when they are not; I also am passionate about supporting and bringing people’s wellbeing up. The group I am apart of is In Memory of John.</p>
	<h2>Michael Ly</h2>          
		<p>My name is Michael Ly (pronounced as Lee), my student number is s3899226 and my school email is s3899226@student.rmit.edu.au, I am a first-year student at RMIT, so there is a lot of things that are new to me. I want to learn everything there is to learn about IT because technology has been growing drastically over the past few years. I was born in Vietnam and moved to Australia in 2012, legally. My main language that I speak is English, but I can also speak Vietnamese fluently. I like to make music but recently I got interested in investing in cryptocurrency, but I also try to explore new things. I never thought that I would go to university and study IT, back in year 11 and the start of year 12, I was dead set on becoming a music producer and would study music, but here I am. My favourite animal is dogs, but my dad will not let me have my pet. I believe if I had a dog, I would be 10 times happier than how I am right now. My ultimate goal in life is to get rich, move out of my parents’ house and get a dog. My favourite thing to watch is anime, it is an easy way to forget about reality for a while… I know it sounds sad. I also like working out and try my best to be consistent.</p>
	<h2>Tinotenda Bhebe</h2>
		<p>Hello, my name is Tinotenda Bhebe, and I am a nineteen years old male raised in Melbourne Victoria and a member of the In Memory Of John team for the Introduction to Information Technology course at RMIT University, my RMIT student id is s3896133; my interest in ICT is born from a desire/passion towards understanding technology and how it works, as a result I have an active interest towards various ICT disciplines from cyber-security, machine learning and networking/remote computing, irrespective of specific discipline my ICT overall interest in ICT relates to computing policy concerns such as cyber-security and information warfare, machine learning and the machine acceleration of Australian workforce as seen in Plan Jericho and more policy related interests; I am currently completing a Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT University to hopefully prepare me for a successful career in IT and to help transform my currently inadequate and limited ICT skill-set and industry knowledge into a skill-set usable in the workforce;outside of ICT my hobbies include online multiplayer video games such as apex legends, endurance road cycling for example a ride between Dandenong and the city and strength training in the gym my hobbies are all based around skills that can be improved or developed as well as directly compared this is because as a person I'm always seeking to improve my skills and I am also a competitive person so any task that lets me do both is likely to instantly become a beloved hobby of mine.</p>
<h2>Group Processes</h2>
<p>As a group we worked well to produce to the final report in assignment 2, the feedback given by individual members identified a lack of communication as a major flaw of the group, thusly entering assignment 3 a more structured approach to communication will be the goal, moreover the use of a pseudo centralised ledger where group members can update their progress towards completing sections of the report will lead to improved awareness of the reports completion progress, beyond that no other changes will be made to the group process.
</P>
<h2>Carrer Plans</h2>
<p>Throughout assignment 2 and 3 members of in memory of John have gotten the opportunity to work together to complete multiple reports and develop a program. These activities have been important in the process of getting our degrees and gaining experience working as part of a group to complete objectives. Ultimately this experience has represented one minor part of our journey as we strive to qualify for our separate ideal jobs, these jobs are:
</p>
<p> 
Jarrod – Principal Security Consultant,
</p>
<p>
Tinotenda - Cyber Security Operations Manager,
</p>
<p>
John – Cyber Security Analyst,
</p>
<p>
Michael – Professional Programmer,
</p>
<p>
Travis – Cyber Security Analyst
</p>
<p>
interestingly four out of five members of the group would like to enter the field of cybersecurity, cybersecurity has seen an explosion in importance, as electronics become a pervasive part of modern living, now more than ever it's important to to ensure the security of our computers, servers, mobile devices, electronic systems, networks, and data from bad actors, Austcyber estimated an additional 18 thousand jobs in the cyber security industry over the next decade, it's been described that Australia has a cyber security shortage taking this into consideration, Jarrod,John,Tinotenda and Travis will soon find themselves in a quickly growing and expanding industry in need of their expertise.
</p>
<p>
Despite multiple members of group seeking to enter the cybersecurity industry, each of their ideal jobs are unique, interestingly cybersecurity consists of roles like penetration testers, code auditors, exploit researchers and more, all members of the group sought defensive cybersecurity roles; Jarrod would like to become a "Principal Security Consultant", which is a senior security planning role, creating information security systems for clients in contrast Tinotenda wants to become a Cyber Security Operations Manager which is a senior role, managing and leading the security of a singular organisation lastly John and Travis would like to become Cyber Security Analysts which are the individuals who assess and research security exploits, there are even more differences between the roles; Tinotenda ideal job requires securing one organisation whilst John, Travis and Jarrod will likely work as contractors or for businesses contracting their skills to service multiple organisations, whilst Jarrod and Tinotenda will likely have to gain leadership experience to manage teams as their ideal jobs are managerial positions, Travis and John will be able to work alone or as part of team and wont require said experience to enter their ideal job;where Jarrod will design information security systems, Tinotenda will have to maintain info-sec systems and respond to breaches and incidents.
</P>
<p>
 Deviating from the rest of the group is Michael ly who aspires to be a software/application developer, application developers are professionals who create and maintain programs, these programs can range from web applications such Facebook and twitter all the way to testing and debugging medical software, as we enter the fourth industrial era, the digitisation and machine acceleration of the economy has created a strong upwards demand for software developers in fact The Department of Employment, Skills, Small and Family Business believes that over the next five years the software development industry will have very strong growth hopefully one of these jobs will be Michaels lys, unlike the cyber security crew Michael will likely be able to work in software/application development industry faster due to the overwhelming demand for employees both entry level and experienced, unlike the high demand for experienced cybersecurity professionals, and small demand for entry level professionals

<h1>Artefact Demonstration</h1>
<img src="pg1.PNG" alt="image of screen">
<img src="page1.png" alt="image of screen">
<h2>Screen 1: The player is presented with a dialogue that provides an introduction to the game, the items in the players possession, the current player health status, an image of what is to be retrieved and finally options the user is able to select. Through this, the user is able to select one of three names that are predetermined beforehand. This ensures that the player cannot input data that is erroneous. As this is the first form it is meant to great the player as well as introduce them to the game. </h2>
<img src="pg2.PNG" alt="image of screen">
<img src="page2.png" alt="image of screen">
<h2>Screen 2: The player on the second screen is presented with an altercation or known as the combat scene. The player sees the “bandit”, which is the image at the top of the form, that has been injured and is presented with options or scenarios that can be taken. The player can still see what is in their possession as well as their health points. On the previous screen, the user was asked to select a name, and this now is present in the current form displayed to the user. Once again, like the previous form there is a dialog to accompany the scenario. </h2>
<img src="pg3.PNG" alt="image of screen">
<img src="page3.png" alt="image of screen">
<h2>Screen 3: The player is presented with the same image as the previous screen as the combat scene hasn’t ended. The items that the player can see would have changed as they are prompted to use them throughout the current screen. Health points will always decrease due to taking damage from the bandit. Although they diminish, players can increase their health by clicking the button that says heal. The button’s for screen three directly affect what happens with the storyline. </h2>
<img src="pg4.PNG" alt="image of screen">
<img src="page4.png" alt="image of screen">
<h2>Screen 4: The player is presented with the same image as the previous screen, but the combat scene has ended. This is the screen that tells the user weather they have won or lost. The buttons direct the users to other sides of the map and story line. The items as well as player health are still displayed to the user. </h2>


<h1>Project Plan / description</h1>
	<h2>Topic</h2>
		<p>The proposed project is an interactive fiction game more widely known as a ”text adventure” game, these are computer games where users typically interact with the in-game environment via prompts and text commands or buttons, text adventures were some of the earliest video games and have undoubtedly become a staple in the video game industry and among programmers due their ease of development and genre agnostic design.
		
The project will be programmed in Visual Basic .NET (VB.NET) a UI focused programming language that properly enforces safe programming and is part of Microsoft .NETframework;players  will  be  capable  of  adequately  exploring  a  branching  narrative  with multiple choices that impact story events and possible outcomes, overall interacting with the game beyond just selecting narrative branches despite being a text adventure game,the game will be primarily designed around a graphical user interface(GUI) but will also support Command-Line Interface (CLI) game play with reduced functionality as a result of VB.NET primarily being a GUI focused programming language.
</p>
	<h2>Motivation</h2>
		<p>The reasons behind why we chose to create a text-based game for our group project was due to the entire group having an interest in the gaming industry; this interest doesn't just involve the games on the market.  It also includes new and upcoming games that showcase an ever-changing world where a person can take the persona of a character and do things that would be impossible in the real world.  Additionally, the advancement and implementation of technology have caused gamers to experience an increasingly realistic experience where the line between real life and the world of gaming continues to become increasingly transparent. Games have the power to influence a person’s view of the world around them; this enables the user to form relationships with other players from across the world. The gaming industry is becoming ever more exciting and interesting and we agreed as a team that we would like to have a taste of what this industry has to offer by creating our own game.
		
Another reason behind why We intend to create a text-based game is because the application we agreed on using to create the game is visual studios which is an integrated development environment.  that has the ability to aid us by pointing out mistakes we've made along the way while developing the game’s interface and the code behind the scenes.Additionally, the majority of our group has had some experience with the visual studio as it was required to be used in our high school software development classes.  Because of this familiarity with the application, it will enable us to streamline the development of the game as we do not need to become acquainted with visual studios beforehand.  This Enables us to have an increase in efficiency while in the creation stage of our text-based game.
</p>
	<h2>Landscape</h2>
	    <p>There are a lot of text-based games available, one of them is called “Pirate Adventure!” This game has a similar concept as our project in terms of , it has options for players to pick and story for the player to follow. But compared to our project, the game has better graphics and has fonts and images that fit the theme of the game. Although our text-based adventure game is done by buttons, that leaves less room for errors and a smoother experience with the gameplay than what is done in other text-based games such as “Pirate Adventure!”.</p>
	<h2>Aim</h2>
		<p>The aim of the project is to create a text adventure game with multiple endings. The player will be presented with different choices throughout the game, these choices change a player’s score. The score determines which of the multiple endings the player experiences. We hope that if we complete our aim, the group will have something to play in our pastime.

The first goal to completing the project is making the story. The story should include an introduction to the game world and what the player is doing in this fictional world. The story itself should be relevant across each stage of the game and provide a sense of immersion inside the game.

 This goal is present because a text-based role-playing game without a storyline does not give the player a role to play.


The second goal is to have the GUI include various elements. These elements include the picture box which contains images that relate to what is happening at each stage of the game. Buttons are there to let the player make choices during gameplay, and labels provide text space for the app to show health points, damage, inventory, as well as show the story.Creating the GUI is a technical objective to see if we can check if we can create a GUI for a text based game.

The third goal is to program the game, this process includes ensuring all the back end elements react to player input via the three interactive buttons. Game logic is built around nested and chained conditionals which trigger various functions, directing narrative. This is the most important objective, since a program cannot operate without working underlying code.
</p>
	<h2>Plans and Progress</h2>
		<p>Our group project idea is to create a text-based adventure game called the mystery of the wasteland ruins.  the game will only be able to be played on pc.  because our group felt making it compatible with mobile would hinder the quality of the game as we would have to adjust the images and text to fit on a small screen this would make the mobile version look far too cluttered and would negatively affect the user experience with the game. 
We decided to create this game with a fiction fantasy demographic as the audience in mind. The target audience would need to be able to have a basic understanding of computers, additionally they will require the ability to read and comprehend information in order to play the game. 
Since the game is text-based with a simple interface that contains an image with the text describing what is happening in the story.  the user will be able to continue the story by pressing buttons on the screen via the mouse left-click this furthers the story and will lead to different outcomes based upon the user’s choice.  by using a combination of images displayed and text on buttons, the user will be able to automatically understand the function of certain controls. 
An example of this in practice is the image of the bandit being hurt after they click the damage button and the screen saying “you have attacked the enemy”.  The benefit of this simple design is that it will enable the user to recognize how to play the game without needing to recall more in depth controls like other games. Being text orientated, graphics are non-existent; it will be a pop-up image depending on the user’s choices accompanied by some text giving an explanation to the goings-on within the story.
 For the game to function correctly it will require the play button when clicked with the left mouse button to start the story so the user can begin playing the game, the quit button will end the game and close the window when clicked. The choice buttons when chosen via left mouse click will require the game to change the background and the text that is present to the text and image that is connected to the user’s choice additionally.
</p>
	<h2>Roles</h2>
		<p>The roles in this project will include lead UI designer, UI designer, lead story writer, story writer, lead programmer and programmer. 

The lead UI designer will be Jarrod, where he will have the job of creating the UI and making sure that it makes sense, that it will not confuse the audience or look cluttered. 

Travis will take the role of lead programmer where he has the responsibility of programming the background code of the game. Making sure that each stage leads to the next and plays out as it’s wanted to be done.

Tino will work as one of the programmers alongside Travis, making sure that the program runs fine and the code works.

John will have the responsibility of being the lead story writer, creating the storyboard, background of the story, scenarios and the flow of the story that is used throughout the game.

Michael will be responsible for assisting John in writing the story and making sure that everything works well with proper writing conventions, etc.
</p>
	<h2>Scopes and limits</h2>
		<p>The game will use buttons and will not accept custom user input. The project will either feature a very minimalist graphical interface with some form of art for each scene and outcome or none at all. The program should output different results for different options selected by users and record said results for use in deciding the ending of the game. Per scene there will be at least two different options with a maximum of three.

The game should not have more than 4 unique endings so it can be completed within the set period allotted for the project. Each scene should contribute to a number score which is processed at the end of the game and ultimately contributes to the ending scene given. The higher the score the ‘better’ the ending will be. Player death will immediately trigger the worse ending by default.

The player and enemies will take turns in combat with up to 3 actions per round, being damage, heal or nothing. Damage in combat scenes will strictly use integer variables rather than float to make it easier for players to read damage scores. When the health points of an enemy reaches 0 the enemy will die, same goes for the player character if they reach 0 health points. In the case of death, the player’s game will reset completely. Damage and health will be reported back to the player via a text box after every combat action. There will be a healing option which will be only for the player, restoring lost health but never going over the player’s HP limit; this will also be reported to the player via text box.

The game will have no animations for combat or any scene in general. If images are included they will be static. There will be no music in the game. 

The player should also be able to enter in a name to call themselves during the duration of each playthrough.

All player interactions will be done through the three buttons which give the players choices to attempt throughout the entirety of the game. Combat gameplay will be done through buttons, making story choices in roleplay will be done via buttons and all other input should be made by clicking any of the buttons.
</p>
   <h2>Testing</h2>
		<p>Our product is an interactive adventure game and is meant for the enjoyment of customers to pass time. To test the product, we will have 15 to 20 people run through the game and report back on what they enjoyed about it, or any errors they encountered during the alpha stage and suggest items in which they wish was included, or what and things that should be improved upon.There is no background required for each user, just an eagerness to play a new text-based game, although it is suggested that each user has a knowledge of how to use a computer and has played/ read a choose your adventure game or book. There also will be a survey with a copy of the game embedded in our product website in the beta stages. The survey will ask questions about the game and have the ability for users to report what they enjoyed and what should be improved like the interviews.
To know the game has succeeded, the game shall have no crashes, and users should enjoy the story line and not have major things suggested to improve upon. Another way to know that we have succeeded is if we were to upload the game to a major app store, for example the Google Play Store, the download number is high and if people are willing to buy advertisement spots.
Since the project involves user testing as stated earlier, the way testing will be set up in the alpha stage is a room will be rented out with a computer running windows and the game loaded as an executable. Through this, the tester can see how the user runs through the game and what struggles occurred. The number of people tested in this will be at a minimum 15 and at most 20, as if a recurring error is present, it will become visible. This will be conducted 3 to 4 times until the team is happy with the final alpha thus becoming a beta.
For Beta testing, the application will be embedded into a website and users provided with a link of the game as well as a survey after a playthrough is completed. Each beta will be updated in a 2-monthly occurrence. After each 2-month period the errors and suggestions will be considered, and the game altered until the “suggestions become fewer. Per beta run, an expected user input is at minimum 100 and at most 1000 survey results.
</p>
   <h2>Risks</h2>
		<p>There are a few risks that we may encounter as we work towards a prototype of our game, these risks could include: Visual basic coding may not be as straightforward and easy to code with which could delay creation of game and or result in poor quality of said game, this could be the case as it may be not as easy or done in the way we would like to have created it, e.g. to creating paths / different scenarios of gameplay may not be the same as you could do in other programming languages.
 
There is also the problem of visual basic programmers not being as experienced or knowledgable as each other to the point which could impede their coding when trying to handle their section of the work, e.g. being asked to do something they don’t know how to do. Another risk is that with the concept of creating a game, we may be able to create a game but will it be very bland and boring to the player and not to us?

The risks specific to the language Visual Basic is that although designing the front end will be easy, the code behind it might be jagged and inefficient. 

One other risk is that only half the group knows how to code in visual basic, which would make testing hard as if there is a detrimental bug within the game, the 2 people that know the language will have t take time to fix it, this is a risk as the work they are currently in the process of finishing gest hindered and often forgotten.
</p>
   
   
<h1>Tools and Technology</h1>
		<p>tools and technology text</p>
	<h2>skills required</h2>
		<p>The development of the text adventure game will require intermediate Visual Basic skills,enough to create a program that uses input, analyses input and provides players with a response most members of the group have these skills. The group requires knowledge on how to use Github  to  update programs, fork  programs, upload programs, record progress and report an issue; all members should have these skills. Text adventure  games  are  also  known  as  interactive  fiction because  at  their core they require strong writing skills to create a compelling narrative that is strengthened by the interactive nature of the medium and not good in spite of it. Coordination and communication skills, as with all projects, members of the group will require  enough  communication  skills  as  to  compartmentalise  and  delegate  tasks,  raise discussions, issues and ideas about the direction of the project and actively participate in the competition of the project, without these skills the project cannot be completed to a high standard.</p>
<h2>Group Processes and Communication</h2>
	<p>Our group will communicate via the software Microsoft Teams in the group call function. We will have a call every Saturday and Sunday between 5-7pm. Outside of standard meetings the group will also be communicating via facebook messenger group chat to discuss issues and deadlines throughout the week when not everyone can communicate simultaneously. If a group member does not respond to a meeting they will first be pinged via Microsoft Teams and then on Facebook Messenger up to two times. In the event that a member is unavailable for a group call they will be informed of any updates via Facebook Messenger.</p>
   
<h1>Outcome</h1>
	<p>Upon completion, members of the group will gain both experience in programming games and in collaborative programming whilst working with a version control system, the group will explore the game development process, and workflow and hopefully users will get a fully functioning and narrative rich work that will engage and entertain them as and when they need at least those users who enjoy the game.</p>

<h1>Group reflection</h1>
<h2>Travis -</h2> <p>What went well with the group was the fact we finished most of our work and began editing much earlier than we did during the last assignment, already starting to edit the document a week before the submission date. However we had some major difficulties in communication as work was done at different times and meetings were still impromptu as we scrambled to get a schedule started. We also had problems with a group member leaving us after the first week, putting us a week behind on website building and certain project related work. We could have improved by creating a meeting schedule before assigning the work.
</p>
<p>
What was surprising was that some group members showed initiative and completed other people’s work. Also, we lost another group member, Dane, just like how we lost Oscar during the first group assignment. I have learned that it is not possible plan fully ahead as there are always unforeseen issues that will arise during group work i.e. Dane leaving.
</p>
<p>
The Github log of activity will mainly show the people that worked on the website and won't show everyone’s contributions as most of the work is first entered into Microsoft Teams or our group’s Google Docs.
</p>

<h2>John -</h2> <p> The group was contributing more work alongside each other earlier on than in the previous assignment, meaning paired work was becoming easier. Sections of work were getting done faster despite having lots of problems with our communication tendencies. Although we had work done, we did also have another member leave the group which I found quite shocking. It definitely did not make any of us feel any better about the group’s standing or assignment work, but they cannot be blamed for that. Of course to reiterate some points, group members picked up works that were left to other members who could not do it entirely by themselves which was fantastic but even still the lack of overall group communication was concerning at times.
</p>

<h2>Jarrod -</h2> 
<p>What worked well
I believe the assignments that were assigned to each member were well-designed, as each team member who worked on something gave it their all and accomplished it well. Each item of work was delivered effectively. One other thing that worked well was the collaboration of coding an application as well as collaborations for the UI design.
</p>
<p>
What could be improved
The communication process as well as the timely completion of activities could have been improved. Because of the incapacity to communicate, there was frequently almost double work as a result of people failing to inform the group of their activities. Furthermore, when work was assigned, the things that were required were not provided, therefore some work was completed but not appropriately. Although assignment 2 we had meetings, throughout assignment 3 we did schedule them, we didn’t stick and follow through with them.
</p>
<p>
At least one thing that was surprising
One thing that surprised me was how easy it was to assign work and accomplish it whenever we did arrange a time to meet. However, once participants were given a task that was within their skill set, the quality of their work improved dramatically. I was surprised also at how well the group coped under pressure. 
</p>
<p>
At least one thing that you have learned about groups
One thing I've learned about groups is that scheduling consultations when everyone is available is quite problematic. When there is no contact, it is also difficult to know what work is being done. One other thing that was learned is that a group with bad habits will continue to have them unless brought up, discussed and rectified. 
</p>
<p>
Remember to include in your section on Tools how well you think your GitHub log of activity reflects your group’s work on this assignment.
The GitHub log from this assignment doesn’t entirely reflect the log from this assignment as we also have many edits and uploads on Teams, Facebook Messenger, Google Docs and  vb.NET. However the work is all there and there are many audit trails that can be followed.
</p>
<p>
Tino -


<h2>Michael -</h2> <p>What went well was that the members of the group were contributing to the assignment and the jobs assigned to each member were completed way sooner than expected. However there wasn’t much communication between the group members because of different time availability or they weren’t checking the messages. We also had a member leave the group in the middle of the assignment so his job had to be completed by other members of the group.</p>

<p>What was surprising was that some group members voluntarily helped complete the jobs of the member that left.</p>

<h2>Group -</h2>  <p>What went well with the group work was that all members completed the majority of the project related tasks before the second week of the assignment.The group is also happy that everyone already began editing the google docs a week before the submission date, affording more time for creating the artefact and building the website.
</p>
<p>
Nevertheless, we had problems relating to communication within the group. These problems mainly stem from the departure of Dane trotman from the group at the beginning of the second week of Assignment 3. The problems included the group being confused about what work needed to be done because of the void left by Dane. We also had issues with gathering everyone together for scheduled group meetings, instead choosing to meet at impromptu times during the week whenever we were all available. The last issue is the lack of work seen in some areas of the assignment that we had to redo during the last night of the assignment when we should have only been putting things together into the website. We could have improved on these issues by having regular meetings everyday on Teams as well as everyone having Teams on their mobile devices so they can receive notifications during their commutes and everyday travel.
</p>
<p>
We found the departure of Dane trotman to be a big surprise to the group, we did not expect for another group member to leave halfway through the semester so soon after the last group member (Oscar Lee) had left. We also all found the amount of work done by some members to be surprising due to some people doing more work than they were originally told, doing other people’s work and confusing members on who had done what when we checked in on things that were to be edited.
</p>
<p>
We all learned that no matter how hard we try, we cannot predict what will happen during an assignment. We recognised that planning ahead could only get us so far until something unexpected happens and we have to adapt. To improve, we found that having multiple alternative plans in case of issues arising within the group had to be created.

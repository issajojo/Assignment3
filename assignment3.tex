\chapter*{Team Profile}
  \section*{Preamble}
  The name we've chosen for our group is "In Memory of John" and was joking-ly coined following John Duong absence to class, since them the name has stuck, and John hasn't been absent.\newline 

  A group consists of various individuals working in tandem, and "In Memory of John" is no different, below is an introduction paragraph for each of the five members of the group; since the previous assignment this section has only had minor changes in response to feedback provided with the notable difference being the loss of group member and friend Dane Trotman Scerri, whom has since left the group irrespective of his departure his contributions to the group have been immense and portions of his work can be found in this report.
	\section{Personal information}

	  \subsection*{Jarrod Franchi}

	      Hi, my name is Jarrod Franchi, my student number is s3900062 and my student email is s3900062@rmit.student.edu.au, I am from Italian and Mauritian backgrounds. I am tri-lingual, my first language is French, then learnt English as well as learnt Italian for all my primary and secondary schooling. I completed year 12 In the year 2020. An interesting fact about myself was that throughout the duration of my secondary schooling I ran a small business for building and selling custom built Gaming Computers for people who were inexperienced in building them, also teaching them how to build them if they wanted. I find building computers a very enjoyable and relaxing pastime. Apart from being a tech nerd, I enjoy playing football, soccer, table tennis and swims either on the beach or in pools. I enjoy thrills and going on long bike rides and doing dangerous stunts like jumping off ramps and man-made mountains with my bikes, my mates and I often go on large mountain biking trips, when we are not, we go for drives in the mountains. Whilst being a large tech nerd, I am a big motor head! I love anything that has a motor, also my favourite car brand would be Holden or Holden Special Vehicles. My interest in IT has been with hardware and software, for hardware I enjoy, as mentioned before, building computers. I am fascinated with how components work in unison (or sometimes against each other). I also find the progress of computers and how they have evolved. Whilst the physical hardware of computers is fascinating, the software that runs on it is quite interesting too. I am blown away by how the software that has been developed can help people and that helps people in their everyday life. My interest in IT started a while ago, maybe in 2010. We had an old Compaq Desktop, and I started to tinker around with various operating systems like Windows Vista, Windows 7 and learning about how components work and what their purposes are. I also dabbled with Virtual machines and their limitations. This sparked an interest with computers and from then on, I found myself picking up old computers and fixing them, taking them apart and learning about how all the hardware works. Another large influence was my father, since he worked largely to do with circuits and electrical items such as fans and lights, I was already more guided to the hardware side of IT. Since I feel knowledgeable to do with the physical side of computers, I wanted to learn about the software side. I have also worked for a company called GS1 (year 10 work placement) which taught me network topology as well as the management of various user’s accounts stored on a centralised server. The group I am apart is In Memory of John.\newline

	  \subsection*{John Duong}

	      John Duong, [student number] - S3896165, [student email] - s3896165@student.rmit.edu.au
	      My name is John Duong (My online tag is issajojo but my internet friends mainly call me by jojo). I was born here in Australia in the town of Sunshine. I am Vietnamese and speak it at home with some English mixed in sometimes, mainly to my siblings that I live with. I just completed high school last year and I am currently a first year studying Bachelor’s of Information Technology. An interesting fact about me is I have a scar on my forehead which had occurred when playing tag in the house, and running into a door with a nail sticking out of it. I enjoy playing games with the homies although I think I've sunk a lot of hours into mobas, specifically League of Legends and Dota 2 (mainly League) but I am still trash at these games for the amount of time I’ve put into them (:D). I also like reading manga as well as manhwa, listening to music, and watching anime. A passion of mine is to try and make my friends happy when they are down or even just to make them laugh when they are not; I also am passionate about supporting and bringing people’s well beings up. The group I am apart of is In Memory of John.\newline

	  \subsection*{Michael Ly}

	      My name is Michael Ly (pronounced as Lee), my student number is s3899226 and my school email is s3899226@student.rmit.edu.au, I am a first-year student at RMIT, so there is a lot of things that are new to me. I want to learn everything there is to learn about IT because technology has been growing drastically over the past few years. I was born in Vietnam and moved to Australia in 2012, legally. My main language that I speak is English, but I can also speak Vietnamese fluently. I like to make music but recently I got interested in investing in cryptocurrency, but I also try to explore new things. I never thought that I would go to university and study IT, back in year 11 and start of year 12, I was dead set on becoming a music producer and would study music, but here I am. My favourite animal is dogs, but my dad will not let me have my pet, I believe if I had a dog, I would be 10 times happier than how I am right now. My ultimate goal in life is to get rich, move out of my parents’ house and get a dog. My favourite thing to watch is anime, it is an easy way to forget about reality for a while… I know it sounds sad. I also like working out and try my best to be consistent.\newline

	  \subsection*{Tinotenda Bhebe}

	      Hello, my name is Tinotenda Bhebe, and I am a nineteen years old male raised in Melbourne Victoria and a member of the In Memory Of John team for the Introduction to Information Technology course at RMIT University, my RMIT student id is s3896133; my interest in ICT is born from a desire/passion towards understanding technology and how it works, as a result I have an active interest towards various ICT disciplines from cyber-security, machine learning and networking/remote computing, irrespective of specific discipline my ICT overall interest in ICT relates to computing policy concerns such as cyber-security and information warfare, machine learning and the machine acceleration of Australian workforce as seen in Plan Jericho and more policy related interests; I am currently competing a Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT University to hopefully prepare me for a successful career in IT and to help transform my currently inadequate and limited ICT skill-set and industry knowledge into a skill-set usable in the workforce;outside of ICT my hobbies include online multi player video games such as apex legends, endurance road cycling for example a ride between Dandenong and the city and strength training in the gym my hobbies are all based around skills that can be improved or developed as well as directly compared this is because as a person I'm always seeking to improve my skills and I am also a competitive person so any task that lets me do both is likely to instantly become a beloved hobby of mine.\newline

	  \subsection*{Travis Lim}

	      Hello, my name is Travis Lim, an Australian born overseas and raised in an Indonesian household. I speak English and have completed primary and secondary education at Good News Lutheran College. Additionally, I’ve graduated from secondary education last year in 2020 and have received an ATAR. My main hobby is gaming on my laptop with my high school friends. I am interested in the field of cyber security because during my later school years I was influenced by my computer teacher into considering the impacts of my actions online and the personal information that I leave behind for corporations to store. I completed all units of VCE software development. I am part of In Memory of John.

\chapter*{Tools(resused)}

  When operating collaboratively it is important to keep an audit trail, tracking individual participation and work contribution as to ascertain;in our group, we failed to maintain an easy to access audit trail, largely due to communication errors within the group, but also due to general collaborative working inexperience; the audit trail that does exist is split across multiple platforms; we used Microsoft teams to share completed information and discuss the project, held meetings in Microsoft teams that were recorded to show the planning that was discussed, Github was used for organising the website and distributing the report within the group, the Github clearly and accurately shows all the work completed on the website, Facebook messenger shows all private communication between the team including requests for information and support, but otherwise due to its nature is not truly representative of the work allocation;lastly in getting the project into the finished report all information was shared across a draft Google Docs, Google docs maintains a record of changes and the information therein is the most accurate record which completed what work and when. Overall whilst we didn't complete work in such a manner as to support a clear audit trail it still possible to track individual project contribution\newline
